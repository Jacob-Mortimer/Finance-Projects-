Monte Carlo Option Pricing

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the price of a European call option and compares it with the Black–Scholes closed-form solution.

optionpricing.py – standalone Python script that runs the simulation.

optionpricing.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with annotated explanations (line-by-line mathematics and Python mechanics).
